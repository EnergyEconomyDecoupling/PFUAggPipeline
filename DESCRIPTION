Description: It is helpful to be able to aggregate and calculate efficiencies for 
             energy conversion chains. 
             This package provides functions to support and create a `targets` workflow
             for such calculations.
             Several targets create outputs in different forms:
             `.csv` files, `.rds` files, and `.pdf` reports.
